# Matt Wycklendt's dotfiles

Inspired (and partially ripped off) from other dotfile repos from https://dotfiles.github.io/

I tend to distro hop, have a lot of random machines (rasberrypi, etc.) and use a lot of VMs so this is a quick way to get my configs set up just the way I want and sync configs across machines.
