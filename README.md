# Matt Wycklendt's dotfiles

Inspired (and partially ripped off) from other dotfile repos from https://dotfiles.github.io/

I tend to distro hop, have a lot of random machines (rasberrypi, etc.) and use a lot of VMs so this is a quick way to get my configs set up just the way I want and sync configs across machines.

to checkout the subrepos that make up this repository:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

update all submodules:
`git submodule update --recursive --remote`

to install YouCompleteMe for vim follow instructions on the github site

Included things:
 - diff-so-fancy -> pretty git diff
 - .vimrc config
 - vim plugin as submodules of this repo
 - .tmux.config
 - .bashrc
 - .bash_profile
